In the single server view above all boxes with text and charts there is an option to select how many hours to view
by using the arrows to the left and the right. Clicking these arrows will navigate forward and backwards in time.

<!--more-->

How many hours of logs available depends on an active plan in a workspace.

If you have the free plan - 12 hours of logs are available, so the 24 hours view will always be half-empty.

With the same plan if you will select the 1 hour window, you will be able to click the left arrow to navigate back
in time till you reach 12 hours back in time.

However, if you have paid plans that provides visibility for up to 2 weeks - accordingly you will be able to
navigate up to 2 weeks back in time.
