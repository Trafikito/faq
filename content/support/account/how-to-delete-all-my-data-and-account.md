You can delete all your data at any time. 

Login to Trafikito and on your account page you will find the option to
delete your account. 

Follow these steps to delete it:

1. Open the main menu on the top left [menu icon]
2. Select **your name**
3. Make sure **Account** tab is active
4. Scroll down to view **Delete account** option
5. Expand **Delete account** and click the **Delete Account** button
6. Confirm deletion


Some logs may still be on our database or cached on our edges but eventually it will be deleted. 

For example the free plan saves logs for 24 hours, paid plans for longer. API call logs are saved for 7 days. 

Such logs will be deleted after it expires and will not be visible to any user when the server is deleted.
