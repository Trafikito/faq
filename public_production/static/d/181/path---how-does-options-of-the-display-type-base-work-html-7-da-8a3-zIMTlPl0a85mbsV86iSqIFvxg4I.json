It can do some basic math and apply suffix to the final number.\n    This is how it works:\n</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>\n    Letâ€™s say we use <span class=\"t-code\">df -P</span> command to get the available disk space and the current value is\n    <strong>3977700</strong>. It means there are <strong>3977700 Kilobytes</strong> left. It is useful to have the raw\n    value to display it on a chart but on a text box it would be better to have a formatted value.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You can set Base as <strong>1024</strong> and add a few names. We will use <span class=\"t-code\">KB</span>, <span\n        class=\"t-code\">MB</span>, <span class=\"t-code\">GB</span> and <span class=\"t-code\">TB</span> for now. Trafikito\n    will take the raw value of <strong>3977700</strong> and divide it by <strong>1024</strong>:\n</p>\n<div class=\"t-code\">3977700 / 1024 = 3884.47265625</div>\n<br>\n<p>\n    While <strong>3884</strong> is more then <strong>1024</strong>, it will be divided again:\n</p>\n<div class=\"t-code\">3884.47265625 / 1024 = 3.7934303284</div>\n<br>\n<p>\n    Now you have decimal places option - how many numbers to show in decimal places. If it is set to <strong>2</strong>,\n    final formatted value will be <strong>3.79</strong> and while it was divided <strong>2</strong> times, the 3rd value\n    name will be used, which in our case is <span class=\"t-code\">GB</span>. So the final render with suffix is: <span\n        class=\"t-code\">3.79 GB</span>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How does options of the display type: base work?","uri":"how-does-options-of-the-display-type-base-work","tags":["data sources"]}}},"pageContext":{"uri":"how-does-options-of-the-display-type-base-work","previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"How the display types string, number, base and percent are different?","uri":"how-the-display-types-string-number-base-and-percent-are-different","tags":["data sources"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Can I have several variables showing the same thing?","uri":"can-i-have-several-variables-showing-the-same-thing","tags":["data sources"]}}}}
