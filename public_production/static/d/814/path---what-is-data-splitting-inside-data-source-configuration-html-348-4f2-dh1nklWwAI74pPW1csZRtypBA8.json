While you need to track some part of the text, e.g. you\n    want to monitor an average load while using <span class=\"t-code\">uptime</span> command.\n</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>This is the sample output of an <span class=\"t-code\">uptime</span> command:</p>\n<div class=\"t-code\">16:32:47 up 3 min, 1 user, load average: 2.3, 0.41, 0.19</div>\n<br/>\n<p>\n    You want the <strong>chart</strong> displaying the current value of <span class=\"t-code\">2.3</span> and the change\n    over time. So you have to extract this number.\n    You can do this by splitting the text into a table using delimiters.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One delimiter is used to split the text into rows and then each row can have the custom delimiter to split it into\n    columns.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After its finished, you have a table and in some cells your required values. Every minute Trafikito gets new output,\n    splits it into a table using the same delimiters and data is updated.\n</p>\n<h4>Note:</h4>\n<p>\n    By default Trafikito sets line delimiter to new line symbol, which is: <span class=\"t-code\">\\n</span> and row\n    delimiter is regular expression <span class=\"t-code\">[,]+</span>, which splits row into columns by one or more space\n    or comma symbols which is what you need most of the time. You will notice that by default settings most of the time\n    you will have data parsing done automatically.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When you have a table with data you can create new variables and assign cells. Variables will always hold updated\n    values of specific cells.\n</p>\n<!-- todo [image/video or something showing all this] -->","frontmatter":{"title":"What is data splitting inside data source configuration?","uri":"what-is-data-splitting-inside-data-source-configuration","tags":["data sources"]}}},"pageContext":{"uri":"what-is-data-splitting-inside-data-source-configuration","previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What is the display type for the variable?","uri":"what-is-the-display-type-for-the-variable","tags":["data sources"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What is data parsing?","uri":"what-is-data-parsing","tags":["data sources"]}}}}
