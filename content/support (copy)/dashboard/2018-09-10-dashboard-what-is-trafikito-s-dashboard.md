A dashboard is a special place where you can see an overview of all your servers in a workspace. You can extensively
check logs over time and change numerous settings.

The dashboard is adjustable, so you can make your desired changes to have a more unique appearance. The two parts
that make up the Dashboard are the servers list and the single server view.
