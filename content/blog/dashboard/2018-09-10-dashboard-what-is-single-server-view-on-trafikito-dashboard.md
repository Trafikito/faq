This view has extended details of the variables being monitored on your server. It can have several types of boxes. 
Boxes with text show the current value of the variables, while boxes with charts provide a visual representation of
how values change over time.

On the server list click **Open** to display the single server view.

The layout and content of the boxes are fully customizable. You can select whether to display variables, text, or 
charts. Also, you will be able to choose what to display in the title of the chart and set the minimum and maximum 
values of the y-axis.

On the bottom right there is an **Edit mode** switch, you will need to turn it on to edit whatever you require. 
You can use the current value of any variable instead of text for all options.

#### Note:

At Trafikito, you can monitor the output of any command. Learn more about how to add custom data sources or variables.
