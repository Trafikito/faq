1.  Make sure you have at least one active server in the free workspace. Each day you will get 0.02% for it.
2.  If you work in a company, recommend Trafikito to monitor their servers and when they buy a paid plan you will get your extra personal discount each day.
3.  Join several companies and suggest Trafikito to them. You will get an extra 0.04% everyday for each.
