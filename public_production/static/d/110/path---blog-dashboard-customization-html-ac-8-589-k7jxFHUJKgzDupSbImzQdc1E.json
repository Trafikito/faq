So, you will need to enter the Edit Mode on your mobile device in order to drag around &#x26; resize the boxes for the mobile view.</p>\n<p>While dragging on a mobile is a little harder, you can just narrow the window of your browser on the desktop to view mobile layout and edit it on the desktop too.</p>\n<h2>Edit Mode</h2>\n<p>You can switch to the Edit Mode and make your desired changes to everything, at any given time. You can add a new block, drag around and resize the existing ones. Plus, you can change the contents of anything and switch a block type from text to chart or chart to text. You can change the line colors of the charts, the title, set the default visibility of the series and the minimum or maximum range of the y-axis. You can use custom text together with variables for all settings.</p>\n<p><gif><img src=\"/dashboard-edit-text-box-58b43a1f873bdf8431364b28be78cd26.gif\" alt=\"Text box edit view at single server view\"></gif></p>\n<h2>Chart vs. Text Blocks</h2>\n<p>Every block may contain text or a chart. In the Edit Mode, you can switch between modes of the block. Currently, you can choose between chart or text but there will be more modes available down the line. In order to have custom auto-updating titles like “RAM free: 1008.91 MB” you can use variables in any settings of a chart or in a text. You will always find all of your variables in settings. The color next to the variable indicates if its value is in the normal, warn or error ranges.</p>\n<p><gif><img src=\"/dashboard-edit-chart-box-085418e1f75bec7532dd09211c895d7b.gif\" alt=\"Text box edit view at single server view\"></gif></p>\n<h2>Working with a Team</h2>\n<p>The dashboard is visible for all active members of the workspace. When boxes are updated, updates are visible for all, in both the desktop and mobile layouts. As a general practice, we recommend giving a minimum specified role to each member of a team to prevent accidents. You can always make changes to the user roles in the workspace settings.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/c984a/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 127.22689075630254%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Trafikito workspace members list\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/44e84/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/68355/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg 148w,\n/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/ada22/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg 295w,\n/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/44e84/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg 590w,\n/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/274de/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg 885w,\n/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/060c5/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg 1180w,\n/static/dafb57044a535684be225cbf78760630/c984a/trafikito-workspace-members-list.jpg 1190w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At Trafikito you can monitor the output of any commands available on your Linux server.
