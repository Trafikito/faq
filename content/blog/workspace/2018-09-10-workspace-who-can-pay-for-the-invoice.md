Anyone. Invoices can be paid by any member of the team. Each invoice has a unique ID which identifies when it’s paid; it is not essential for Trafikito to ascertain which member paid. The invoice can be paid or not paid. Keep in mind that we don’t facilitate refunds; while you can use the free plan to check if Trafikito is suitable for you.
