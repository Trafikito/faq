Crontab will make sure Trafikito agent is running. However, If you don't\n    want to use crontab, that's fine. Just make sure the agent file is always running.

Then, click \"Install agent\", a modal window\n        will appear with the commands to download and run the Trafikito installation script. Since you’re not using\n        Ubuntu you will have to select the \"Other Linux\" tab.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Copy code from the first box and paste it in Termux. Then, click enter to execute.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Copy and execute the second part of the code. Please note that most Linux environments have a temporary\n        directory on the root path but Termux does not.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        After, you will be presented with the Trafikito agent installation splash screen. Just choose the directory path\n        where you want to install the agent and click enter to execute it.
