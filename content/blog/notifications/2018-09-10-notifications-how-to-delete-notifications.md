<!-- more -->

1.  Open the main menu on the top left \[menu icon\]
2.  Select **Dashboard**
3.  In the servers list find the server you want to edit and click **Open** next to it
4.  On the top right click **Settings**
5.  Use the Show button next to **Notifications** to show the notifications list.
6.  Click on the notification to delete
7.  Scroll down and click **Delete** under all notification settings
8.  Confirm deletion and it is done.

You can also delete several notifications at once. To do this, go to the 
notification list and check several notifications simultaneously by using 
the checkboxes in front of the notifications name that you wish to delete.
After at least one notification is checked, mass action options will be 
revealed above the list. One of the option is to delete all selected notifications.
