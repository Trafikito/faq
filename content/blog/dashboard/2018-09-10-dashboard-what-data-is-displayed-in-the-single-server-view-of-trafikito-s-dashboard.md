A single view layout is fully customizable. It reports whatever makes sense in your case. During installation, Trafikito 
tries to retrieve the usage data of all basic resources, such as `CPU`, `RAM`, `disk space`, and `average load`, 
this data will be used to generate an initial dashboard for you with some text boxes and charts showing the status 
and changes over time.

To start monitoring the output of any command, open settings on the single server view and make changes to data sources. 
From there, you will be able to create, edit or remove variables that are visible in the charts and text boxes within the single server view.

To learn more, browse this FAQ site or visit Trafikito’s Youtube channel.

#### Note:

To make any changes, you must have an admin or owner role in an active workspace. All changes will be applied to all members of that particular workspace.
