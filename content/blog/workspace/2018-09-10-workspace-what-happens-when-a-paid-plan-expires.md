Only the owner can login to the workspace. As well as all limits are downgraded to the free plan. As a result, you may experience a broken dashboard if your charts depend on the data that is no longer available. Just generate a new invoice to buy more time on the paid plan. After which. it will go back to normal with no extra configuration required.
