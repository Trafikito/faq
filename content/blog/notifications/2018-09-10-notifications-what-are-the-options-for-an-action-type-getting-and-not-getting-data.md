1.  **Getting or not getting for** specified minutes. You can select how long to wait before firing actions. The minimum amount is 5 minutes because it’s ok if your server is running but a network failure resulted in logs not being delivered to Trafikito. However, if it happens for more than 5 minutes then it’s an issue not just a random event.
2.  **Wait before firing again** - you can set if when cases should be fired several times and how long to wait before firing again.
