This means you can use regular expression syntax as the delimiter. This is a very powerful way to\n    split by anything in the text.\n</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>\n    E.g. default delimiter to split the row into columns is <span class=\"t-code\">[,]+</span> which is a regular\n    expression. It means\n</p>\n<blockquote>split by sequence of space or comma characters. There may be one or more of these in a row.</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n    It will split text by any combination of spaces and commas. All these texts would be split into 3 columns\n    with values “Foo” “bar” and “baz”:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><span class=\"t-code\">Foo bar baz</span></li>\n    <li><span class=\"t-code\">Foo bar baz</span></li>\n    <li><span class=\"t-code\">Foo , bar baz</span></li>\n    <li><span class=\"t-code\">Foo,bar,baz</span></li>\n    <li><span class=\"t-code\">Foo, bar, baz</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    To learn more take a look at <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/pTV5Ys/1\" target=\"_blank\">https://regex101.com/r/pTV5Ys/1</a>\n    which is a tool to write and test regular expressions. Make sure to select JavaScript flavor on the left, in some\n    cases, there is a slight difference.\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is a regex?","uri":"what-is-a-regex","tags":["data sources"]}}},"pageContext":{"uri":"what-is-a-regex","previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What is data parsing?","uri":"what-is-data-parsing","tags":["data sources"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What happens when new data arrives at Trafikito?","uri":"what-happens-when-new-data-arrives-at-trafikito","tags":["data sources"]}}}}
