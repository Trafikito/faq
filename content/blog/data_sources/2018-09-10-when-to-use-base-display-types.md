When you have numeric values to track and it needs to be divided by some base. You can also add some suffix next to the value. A good example is the **size of bytes**. If the command return bytes and you want to see Megabytes or Gigabytes, you have to use display type: **base**.

Default options will have base defined as 1024 and it will have several options to convert bytes to KB, MB, GB, TB. You can delete any of these and replace it with what makes sense for you.
