To save changes you must click **Save data source** so you can experiment with parsing settings without saving and nothing will be changed.

While changing the parsing settings you will immediately see the updated table of data. If the data location changes in a table, then variables assigned to the table must be updated too.

**Example**: If the previous value of **load_1** was inside cell **A2** 0.21 and now it is in **A11.** The variable **load\_1** is still pointing to **A2** 01:51:48, which is the current serverâ€™s time now. To fix it, just select **A11** from the drop-down in the variables settings.
