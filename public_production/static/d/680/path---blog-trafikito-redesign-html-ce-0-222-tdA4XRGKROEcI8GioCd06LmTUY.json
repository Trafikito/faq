Now, the color palette is more\n    unique, which is a major plus for Branding.\n</p>\n<h3>Text Alignment</h3>\n<p>\n    Visual aesthetics are very important. Have you ever visited a site and the text was way too difficult to read? Well,\n    that’s simply annoying. So, I ensured that the copy was clearer and shorter. Now, the text alignment looks better.\n</p>\n<h3>Less Visual Noise</h3>\n<p>\n    Numerous layout issues were fixed. Now, the overall user experience is better and it’s easier to find required\n    options. Basically, there's less visual noise.\n</p>\n<h2>User Interface (UI)</h2>\n<h3>All about the user experience.</h3>\n<p>\n    UI is all about the user experience. It’s everything that users use to interact with software. Basically, it's all\n    the visual elements, including text. The UI can be GUI (graphical user interface) or CLI (command line interface).\n    Trafikito is using GUI on the web and is now faster than ever.\n</p>\n<h3>The Build is Smaller & Loads are Faster</h3>\n<p>\n    The size was 1.2MB but it was reduced by 500 KB and now it's 730 KB. Also, the initial load is faster for first-time\n    visitors and there’s faster response on user interaction. Significantly there are fewer resources used to load the\n    website (less CPU used from user's machine = better battery life for users).\n</p>\n<h3>Re-Paints & Re-Flows</h3>\n<p>\n    Re-Paints are part of the process to display elements on the UI. The re-paints and re-flows were both optimized on\n    Trafikito, so all UI requires fewer resources from the user's machine. This means less battery drain on mobile\n    devices.

At first, it was 3 steps but now it's only 1 step installation. Now,\n    it's clearer, the loads are faster and there’s an option for other Linux machines. Lastly, the Installation process\n    was updated, shebang in a shell script is more portable + fixed several minor issues. Also, I added extra caching to\n    deliver agent faster and overall it’s simplified.\n</p>\n<p>{% include image.html file=“trafikito-monitoring-install-agent.png” alt=“Installing Trafikito agent” %}</p>\n<h2>Back-End Optimizations</h2>\n<p>\n    These past few weeks, I started using Redis database more heavily to cache many things. After this was updated, the\n    main database is receiving 40-60% fewer queries per minute, everything overall works faster and it requires less RAM\n    & CPU.\n</p>\n<h2>Social Channels</h2>\n<p class=\"t-quote\">\n    Don’t use social media to impress people; use it to impact people. - Dave Willis\n</p>\n<p>\n    The final move was to introduce Trafikito to everybody and what better way to make an introduction than social\n    media.
